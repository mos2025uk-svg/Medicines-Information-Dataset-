# Medicines-Information-Dataset-
This project focuses on analyzing and leveraging large-scale textual medicine data for multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It is based on the MID (Medicine Intelligence Discovery) dataset, which contains detailed textual information on more than 192,000 pharmaceutical products spanning 44 therapeutic classes.

The goal is to explore how modern NLP techniques—ranging from traditional machine learning to deep learning—can be applied to real-world medicine-related text data.
